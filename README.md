This is a two-player dice game where each player takes turns rolling a dice. Player 1 starts by rolling the dice as many times as they wish, accumulating the rolled numbers into their current score. The player can choose to hold at any time, adding the current score to their total score and passing the turn to the other player. However, if a player rolls a 6, their turn immediately ends, and they lose any points accumulated during that turn. The game continues until one player reaches a total score of 100, winning the game.
